# Developer Guide
## Building the project

### First-time set-up
To build the project for the first time, run

```sh
./gradlew build
```

and validate that it completes successfully.

You can then browse auto-generated library docs by opening app/build/dokka/html/index.html in a browser.

### Subsequent builds
In order to clean up stale build artifacts and rebuild the API models based on your latest changes, run

```sh
./gradlew clean build
```

If you do not clean before building, your local environment may continue to use stale, cached artifacts in builds.

### Running local integ tests
Prerequisite set-up:
1. Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Launch Docker Desktop and create or sign into a Docker account

To run local integ tests against test containers, run

```sh
./gradlew localIntegTest -DrunLocalIntegTests=true
```

#### Debugging local integ tests

Helpful localIntegTest options:
* `--info` - print info logs to console
* `--rerun-tasks` - force rerun even if prior integ test run, use if auto-completes with message `Configuration cache entry reused.`

Integ test code snippets to help with debugging:
* Can use `localstack.printLogs()` to print container logs for debugging.
* If need to debug LocalStack startup issues, update the `LocalStackContainer` definition to include:
  * `.withEnv("LS_LOG", "trace") // Enable detailed logging for debugging`
  * `.withEnv("DEBUG", "1") // Enable debug mode`

## Helpful commands

* `./gradlew build` - build project, run lint checker, and run unit tests
* `./gradlew clean build` - clear build artifacts, rebuild project, run lint checker, and run unit tests
* `./gradlew detekt` - run lint checker
* `./gradlew run` - run the application
* `./gradlew tasks` - list available Gradle tasks
* `./gradlew test` - run unit tests
* `./gradlew test --tests TestClass --info` - run unit tests from a specific test class with info-level logging, helpful when debugging errors
* `./gradlew test --tests TestClass.TestMethod --info` - run a specific unit test with info-level logging, helpful when debugging errors

## Troubleshooting

#### My local tests failed but the output doesn't include logs or stack traces needed to debug

Run `./gradlew build --info` to rerun the tests with info logging enabled, which will include logs and stack traces for failed tests.

#### My local builds are not picking up Gradle dependency changes

Run `./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies` to ignore your Gradle environment's cached entries for modules and artifacts, and download new versions if they have different published hashsums.
